## Hop n Hop
Peter Rabbit lives in a colony. He is the only rabbit in his colony who is not able to hop. On his 5th birthday, his father rabbit gifted him a pogo stick as he could not jump like the other rabbits. He is so excited to play with the pogo stick. The pogo stick hops one unit per jump. He wanders around his house jumping with pogo sticks. He wants to show the pogo stick to his friends and decides to go using pogo sticks. Write a program to find the number of hops needed to reach his friends' house. Assume that Peter Rabbit's house is in the location (3,4).
### INPUT FORMAT:
Input consists of two integers x,y.
The x and y correspond to x and y coordinates of his friends' house.
### OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output is an integer. It corresponds to the number of hops needs to reach his friends' house.

## Four musketeers
Dhoni joined the group of 3 Musketeers and now their group is called four Musketeers. Meanwhile, Dhoni also moved to a new house in the same locality nearby to the other three. Currently, the houses of Sachin, Dravid and Ganguly are located in the shape of a triangle. When the three musketeers asked Dhoni about the location of his house, he said that his house is equidistant from the houses of the other 3. Can you please help them find out the location of the house? Given the 3 locations {(a1,b1), (a2,b2) and (a3,b3)} of a triangle, write a program to determine the point which is equidistant from all the 3 points.
### INPUT FORMAT:
Input consists of 6 integers.
The first integer corresponds to a1.
The second integer corresponds to b1.
The third and fourth integers correspond to a2 and b2 respectively.
The fifth and sixth integers correspond to a3 and b3 respectively.
### OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output consists of two floating point numbers which correspond to the location of the house.

They decided to share the treasure. Blackbeard agreed to give x% share for Long Ben. He then decided to take y% share from the remaining treasure. His other pirates will share the remaining gold coins equally. Write a program to compute their share's.
### INPUT FORMAT:
Input consists of 3 integers.
The first input corresponds to the number of gold coins in the treasure.
The second input corresponds to Ben's share percentage and the last input is Blackbeard's share percentage.
### OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output consists of three integers.
The first output integer corresponds to Long Ben's share.
The second integer corresponds to Blackbeard's share.
The last integer corresponds to other pirates share.
